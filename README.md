# Understanding Italian Administrative Texts

This repository contains materials regarding a reader-oriented study about the comprehension of texts with two different levels of readability in the Italian administrative language.

### Data
The data folder contains the results of three subject groups involved in a comprehension test: Italian L2, elderly Italian native speakers, and a control group. The files also contain the linguistic feature extracted from the examined texts to be analyzed along with participants' error rate in answering specific questions about the texts' content. An additional file contains the results for a more specific analysis of the L2 group's results.  

### Code
These data were analyzed through linear mixed models and a Principal Component Analysis of the linguistic features extracted. The R notebooks of such analyses are contained in the code folder. 

### Citation
This study is described in the paper "Understanding Italian Administrative Texts: A Reader-oriented Study for Text Readability and Simplification" by Martina Miliani, Marco Senaldi, Gianluca Lebani, and Alessandro Lenci. The paper appears in the proceedings of the 1st edition of the workshop AIxPA (AIxIA 2022 conference).
